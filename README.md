# Lung Cancer Prediction based on provided parameters

## Executive summary
By using user data such as alcohol usage, cigaratte smoking and similar parameters we need to predict presence of lung cancer in new patient when given similar parameters

## Rationale
Cancer prediction is invaluable given today's rising cancer rates among people

## Research Question
Given a set of parameters will we be able predict presence of cancer of not

## Methodology
We are using multiple regression and other technics to construct models to predict this

## Results
Logistic regression works better than most other models with higher accuracy. 
Users who present with higher alcohol consumption, swallowing difficult will needs more immediate attention.

## Next steps
We need to collect more data with additional parameters to distill these results even more. socio economic conditions, geographical information etc will help us construct more accurate models
